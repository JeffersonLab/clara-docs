### Why CLARA?

Some of the contemporary scientific problems require multidisciplinary and/or trans-disciplinary 
approach to achieve satisfactory answers. Traditional intra-disciplinary research had evolved in 
quasi-isolation, providing scientists theoretical canons, methodologies and frameworks unique for 
a specific field of study.  Increasing importance of issues concerning the linked nature of the 
physical world coupled with a growing understanding of system complexity leave traditional scientific 
disciplines often struggling. Even within the same discipline different research groups have difficulties 
linking together different studies.   Unification of software tools, algorithms and computational 
strategies across multiple disciplines is unimaginable, yet common; machine interpretable data 
description is quite feasible. So, if we can imagine a software application, build as network of 
“black box” independent processes that exchange data only, the design a software application for 
an inter-disciplinary study suddenly becomes a reality.
