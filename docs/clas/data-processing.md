Really, though,
do we need to get our hands dirty and start processing the raw data?
After all we did our fair share when we were post-docs.
Just sit back, relax and listen Erik Satie.
The DST will be ready soon...
But OK, I know, I know you’re one of the small minority of scientists that can't wait,
who need to process subset of data quickly,
define and customize data processing conditions (I am not suggesting post-doc mistrust here),
or you think you do, or (more accurately) feel like you do.
We’re happy to exploit that feeling. I want to be clear though:
we’re not here to tell you what you want.
Still, something in our science DNA compels us to be honest about this:
you should follow the following instructions to start data processing yourself.

In this chapter we present instructions
how to run CLARA based CLAS12 data processing application.

We assume that the CLARA\_HOME env variable is pointing to
the CLARA run-time environment directory.

No just simply type 

```
$CLARA_HOME/bin/clara
```

This will start Clara command line interactive interface.
Hierarchical help will navigate you through options to set, customize, run and monitor 
Clas12 data processing applications.
