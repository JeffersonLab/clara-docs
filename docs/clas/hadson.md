*The future belongs to the few of us still willing to get our hands dirty*

Ah! Clara, Clara: the unicorn of data processing frameworks that everyone craves to learn it.

Just kidding...

No one wants to learn Clara, hmmm... may be except of the JLAB CLAS12 collaboration members,
that for some unlucky circumstances signed up for a service work to process the experimental data.

OK then, for those unlucky ones let's start!

### Were do we start?

First you have to define if a) you are going to use Clara clas12 common (official) installation
or b) you want to have your own installation (e.g. in your home institution or in your own laptop).

### I want to use common installation
Ok then, we have to perform the following steps:

1. Set environmental variable CLARA_HOME pointing to the common installation directory.
Make sure you have read and execute permissions in that file system.
2. Set environmental variable CLARA_USER_DATA that points to a directory where you will store
Clara application service composition and data-set description files, as well as data
processing logs, and possibly actual data files.
3. Run the Clara CLI:

It is recommended for the CLARA_USER_DATA directory to have a specific file structure:

```
 |____config
 |____log
 |____data
 | |____input
 | |____output
 ```

<div class="note info">
It is OK not to create the structure by hand. Clara CLI (command line interface) will check/create
the necessary file structure at the startup.
</div>

Let us start Clara CLI by typing the following:

```
vem:~ gurjyan$ /group/da/vhg/testbed/clara/myClara/bin/clara-shell
Warning: CLARA_USER_DATA environmental variable is not assigned.
         It will be set to point to the CLARA_HOME.
         Note that you might face permission exceptions.
```

oops... I forgot to set CLARA_USER_DATA environmental variable. Let's try it one more time.

```
vem:~ gurjyan$ $CLARA_HOME/bin/clara-shell

 Run 'help' to show available commands.

```

It's a success...

Now we can play by typing `help` and learn more about this interactive
shell that makes data processing (including application customization,
data-set selection, application deployment, scaling, and monitoring,
and much more) simply an enjoyable experience.

Since we are not getting any younger, let us spare some time and show how we can reconstruct
a given data file locally, i.e. on a local (on your own) computer.

### Processing a data file

Clara considers default locations to access data files, the application
service-composition file (usually services.yml, yet it can have any arbitrary name),
data-set description file (e.g. files.list: this is text file containing the
names of all data files) as well as log files (usually for every data processing
Clara creates 2 log files: DPE and workflow-manager logs). To see the default locations/settings,
type in the CLI the following command:

```
clara> show config

servicesFile:        "$CLARA_HOME/config/services.yaml"
fileList:            "$CLARA_USER_DATA/config/files.list"
inputDir:            "$CLARA_USER_DATA/data/input"
outputDir:           "$CLARA_USER_DATA/data/output"
outputFilePrefix:    "out_"
logDir:              "$CLARA_USER_DATA/log"
session:             "gurjyan"
description:         "clara"
farm.cpu:            0
farm.memory:         0
farm.disk:           5
farm.time:           1440
farm.os:             "centos7"
farm.node:           ""
farm.exclusive:      ""
farm.stage:          NO VALUE
farm.track:          "debug"
farm.scaling:        0
farm.system:         "jlab"
```

Usually `show config` will show full path with environmental variables resolved.

<div class="note info">
Note that these are default settings, and user can change to point to different locations.
</div>

Now let us switch to other workspace, or just simple exit the Clara CLI ( Ctrl-C ).
First thing we have to do is to copy (or jget) our data file into the $CLARA_USER_DATA/data/input directory.
E.g.

```
cp /work/clas12/data/clas_004013.0.hipo $CLARA_USER_DATA/data/input/.
```

Next we create the files.txt file in the $CLARA_USER_DATA/config dir and add a single line to it:

```
gurjyan@clara1601:work/config$ more files.list
clas_004013.0.hipo
```

For this exercise we will be using the official (commonly distributed)
CLAS12 reconstruction application service composition file ($CLARA_HOME/config/services.yaml).
That's it. Let us call again the Clara CLI and start the processing by typing `run local`:

```
vem:~ gurjyan$ $CLARA_HOME/bin/clara-shell

If you get this console printouts then congratulations!!!
You can go and have a drink now. No seriously. This will take a while. Go...

Are you back? While you were drinking, and having fun I was working.
That's fine... I like working, because it mesmerizes me.
I can sit and look at it for hours :)

The processing is complete. If everything went smooth we will get a
benchmark results on the CLI console, indicating total and average
processing times in each service engine of the reconstruction application,
average time spent by the entire application and time spent by workflow management system
(orchestrator).

### Where is my output

Reconstructed file will be physically stored in `outputDir:  "$CLARA_USER_DATA/data/output"`.
(remember the CLI `show config` command?).

```
clara> show outputDir
total 81M
-rw-r--r-- 1 gurjyan da 21M Feb  1 09:18 out_clas_004013.0.hipo

clara>
```

The data processing log files will be stored in `logDir: "$CLARA_USER_DATA/log"`.

```
clara> show logDir
total 325M
-rwxr-xr-x 1 gurjyan da 4.0K Jan 30 15:06 129.57.75.136_gurjyan_clara_orch.log
-rwxr-xr-x 1 gurjyan da  89K Jan 30 15:12 129.57.75.136_gurjyan_clara_fe_dpe.log

clara>
```

Now a little bit about the file naming convention. As you can see the
reconstructed file name is created by adding the `out_` prefix to the
actual input data file name. This prefix is configurable, and can be
set/changed using the following CLI command:

```
clara> set outputFilePrefix myOwnPrefix_
clara> show config
```

Clara log files are critical for data preservation, monitoring and debugging.
So, that is the reason log file names some of the important information,
such as the node where the processing was performed (in our example node
IP = 129.57.75.136), data processing session(by default data processing
session is set to be the user name. In our example session = gurjyan),
and data processing description ( for this example description = clara).
The data processing session and description are CLI configurable options
and can be set by the following command set:

```
clara> set session myOwnSession
clara> set description myOwnDescription
clara> show config
```

<div class="note warning">
We recommend the session and the description to be unique for every new data-set processing.
</div>

We can do a lot without exiting the Clara CLI. For e.g. we can analyse
the log files using the following commands:

```
clara> show loggDPE
clara> show logOrchestrator
```

### Application customization
While CLAS12 reconstruction application is the best-in-class :),
it won't do you any good if it is missing one key feature.
Clara provides application flexible customization to fit your needs.
E.g. you want to pass engine specific configuration options or change
application service composition by adding or removing service engines, etc.
All this is possible with Clara. You will understand me if you ever played
with LEGO. Ok let us see it on an example. Below is the official CLAS12 reconstruction
application service-composition, that can be accessed through the following command:

```
clara> show services

```

The command above printed the content of the Clara application composition YML file,
the location of which is configurable through the following command:

```
clara> set servicesFile /myOwnDir/myOwnService.yml
clara> show config
```

Noticed that I am calling `show config` after every `set` command just
to remind you about this useful command that shows data processing
application configuration options. It does not have any other purpose
other than that (arguably useful, ha ha).
Ok, let us examine CLAS12 reconstruction official services.yml file, the default location being at:

```
clara> show config
servicesFile:        "$CLARA_HOME/config/services.yaml"
...
```

The service composition file consists of the following sections:
- Stream builder and stream consumer services. This are IO services
that access a data source and create a stream of data quanta that are
dispatched to data processing services.

```
io-services:
  reader:
    class: org.jlab.clas.std.services.convertors.HipoToHipoReader
    name: HipoToHipoReader
  writer:
    class: org.jlab.clas.std.services.convertors.HipoToHipoWriter
    name: HipoToHipoWriter
```

- Data processing services

```
services:
  - class: org.jlab.clas.swimtools.MagFieldsEngine
    name: MAGFIELDS
  - class: org.jlab.rec.ft.cal.FTCALEngine
    name: FTCAL
```

We describe a service by defining the service engine clas and a by giving a name.
So, this means that we can have multiple services with different names sharing the same engine.
May be not so useful, but one can configure the same engine differently and build and
stream events through a limited cycle loop (note: no programing is necessary).

- Section describing configuration options for services.
In this section users can describe configuration parameters for IO and
processing services, as well as configuration options for a specific service
(e.g. parameter `useStartTime`for DCHB service).

```
configuration:
  io-services:
    writer:
      compression: 2
# settings below are for GEMC, compatible with 4a.2.4
  services:
    DCHB:
      useStartTime: "true"
      wireDistortionsFlag: "false"
      geomDBVariation: may_2018_engineers
    DCTB:
      geomDBVariation: may_2018_engineers
```

- Data tyoe of the streaming event (data quantum).

```
mime-types:
  - binary/data-hipo
```

So you can add a new service to the application by providing `clas`
of the an engine and an arbitrary `name` (preferably something descriptive).
Removing a service is as simple as deleting or commenting out the two lines in yml file, describing a service.
  E.g. below shows the clas12 modified reconstruction application ,where we keep two standard services from
  the reconstruction official application and add two services, sharing the same engine. Here we demonstrate
  testing and debugging a new reconstruction engine with two different configuration options.

```
clara> set servicesFile /myOwnDir/myOwnService.yml
clara> show services

### Running on a farm
*Old macdonald sends a farmJob e-i-e-i-o...*

Yup, this is that easy. You do not have to write a farm submission scripts, and
farm deployment can be done without leaving the Clara CLI. Let us show it on an example.

I have a data set consisting of 4 files (I can see my data-set using the
command: `show files`. see below), and I want to process it on the JLAB farm.
```
clara> show files
clas_004013.0.hipo
clas_004013.1.hipo
clas_004013.2.hipo
clas_004013.3.hipo

clara>
```
The following settings will configure my farm deployment:

- Make sure user data is  accessible from the farm mounted file system.
This includes input/output data directories, application and data-set
description files, log directory and farm-job PBS/SLIRM scripts.

```
clara> set inputDir /work/clas12/gurjyan/Testbed/clara/data/input
clara> set outputDir /work/clas12/gurjyan/Testbed/clara/data/out
clara> set servicesFile /work/clas12/gurjyan/Testbed/clara/services.yaml
clara> set fileList /work/clas12/gurjyan/Testbed/clara/files.list
clara> set logDir /work/clas12/gurjyan/Testbed/clara/log
```


<div class="note info">
You can minimize manual settings in CLI (using default settings) by defining CLARA_USER_DATA environmental
variable pointing to a user-data directory that is visible to the farm system. Note that
this must be done prior running the `clara-shell` executable.
</div>


- Define the data-processing session and the description.

```
clara> set session gurjyanSession
clara> set description gurjyanDescription
```

- Set the vertical scaling parameter (so called multi-threading, i.e.
how many threads you wish will process the data in parallel).

```
clara> set farm.cpu 8
```

- Request the memory and the disk space for the job.

```
clara> set farm.memory 30
clara> set farm.disk 10
```

These are typical settings for 8 core jobs that will work on all JLAB farm nodes.
If you need to increase core count please refer to
[Farm deployment](https://claraweb.jlab.org/clara/docs/clas/farm-deployment.html) for more information.


That's it. Now we launch the farm job, yet, it is a good practise check
the settings before a farm deployment (I am sure you remember the CLI command `show config`).

To run a farm job execute the following command in the CLI:

```
clara> run farm
Parsing script ... (it may take while)
<jsub><request><index>30283608</index><jobIndex>63238147</jobIndex></request></jsub>
```

We can monitor the job submission by:

```
clara> show farmStatus
JOB_ID    USER      STAT    QUEUE      EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME         SUBMIT_TIME   CPU_TIME  WALLTIME  ACCOUNT
63238147  gurjyan     A    priority    --         ...urjyan-clara   Feb 05 13:55  --         --         clas12
```
