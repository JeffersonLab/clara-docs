        Clara service based applications are proficient of responding to the data processing challenges of today and
        flexible enough to adapt to the data world of tomorrow. Clara makes possible transitioning of monolithic
        applications to micro-services architecture, capable of addressing modern data processing
        imperatives: speed, agility and scalability.

      <p class="col-sm-7">
        Clara services can be hot deployed, meaning they can be inserted into a running data processing application,
        without bringing entire system down. If one service stops working in a Clara application it is easy to replace
        the faulty service with the new working copy of it. The time taken for this recovery is a fraction of a time
        required to restart a monolithic application. Since Clara functions at a application granular level, new
        services can be offered and seamlessly integrated into a running application, making application operational
        elasticity a reality.

      <h3 class="col-sm-7 landing-row-title">Horizontal and vertical scalability</h3>
      <p class="col-sm-7">
        Clara application is highly scalable, since individual services show no external dependencies, and can be
        scaled to enhance the performance if demand for the particular service increases. Services are loosely coupled
        and independent, making them more flexible and responsive to change.

        Clara service is responsible for only well defined thing, and thus required less code and is easy to understand
        and change. This saves development time and therefore increases overall productivity.
